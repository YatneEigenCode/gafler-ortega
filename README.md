# gafler-ortega
android app repository

5-5-2015
This is an empty app that was renamed from the original app ID. 
Four files were changed including the folder containing MainActivity.java file.
The original android project (gradle) was created in Android Developer tools (API 16?) on windows. 
It compiles successfully using AIDE on Android, which supports gradle.
However Android Developer Tools (ADT)/Eclipse on mac does not recognize this as an android project and
will not compile it. The ADT was only up to API 17 (Android 4.2)
